## Description

- I completed an internship at ITI, where I received intensive training in web development using .NET.
- This comprehensive program covered SQL Server, C#, LINQ, Entity Framework, and MVC architecture.
- The highlight of the internship was a project focused on Movies CRUD operations, as well as authentication and authorization.
